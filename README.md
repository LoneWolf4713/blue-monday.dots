##### *" Blue Monday" ? *
Yes, I based this off the song "Blue Monday" by New Order. It has always been a good song to me, I have always enjoyed listening to it but at the time of making this rice, something is happening in my life that directly resonates with the lyrics of the song.....

> *I still find it so hard  
To say what I need to say  
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me  
Just how I should feel today*

> *But if it wasn't for your misfortune   
> I'd be a heavenly person today*

If you've read this, thank you, I hope you'll like this and it inspires you. If it does, leave a star ;)
Thank you!
